Number Guessing Game  

A simple and fun number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.  
After each guess, the game gives feedback:  

 📉 Too Low – if your guess is smaller than the number  
 📈 Too High – if your guess is greater than the number  
 🎉 Correct – when you guess the right number
